## Time Estimates

### Game Mechanics

- **Level timer**: 2 minutes per level
- **3-star requirement**: 100% of mastery count with ≥85% accuracy
- **Dynamic difficulty**: Mastery counts are calibrated so a fluent student can complete them in 2 minutes. Higher mastery counts indicate simpler, faster questions; lower mastery counts indicate more complex questions.

### Understanding Mastery Counts

The mastery count reflects the expected CQPM (Correct Questions Per Minute) for a fluent student:

| Mastery Count | Question Complexity | Examples |
|---------------|--------------------| ---------|
| 60-80 | Very simple (1-2 sec/question) | Basic single-digit facts |
| 40-60 | Simple (2-3 sec/question) | Single-digit facts, simple comparisons |
| 20-40 | Moderate (3-6 sec/question) | Extended facts, multi-step mental math |
| 10-20 | Complex (6-12 sec/question) | Multi-digit operations, fractions |
| 6-10 | Very complex (12-20 sec/question) | Multi-digit multiplication, fraction operations |

### Scenario 1: Fluent Student (Demonstrating Mastery)

A student who already has automaticity can complete each level in approximately 2 minutes:

| Grade | Levels | Minimum Time |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Grade 1 | 11 | 22 minutes |
| Grade 2 | 15 | 30 minutes |
| Grade 3 | 19 | 38 minutes |
| Grade 4 | 17 | 34 minutes |
| Grade 5 | 15 | 30 minutes |
| **TOTAL** | **77** | **154 minutes (~2.5 hours)** |

### Scenario 2: Learning Student (Building Fluency)

For students building fluency, the time per level depends on how many attempts they need before achieving mastery. Because mastery counts are calibrated to 2-minute completion times, students spend roughly the same amount of time per level regardless of complexity—they just answer fewer, harder questions or more, easier questions.

**Estimated attempts per level for a learning student:**

| Student Profile | Avg. Attempts per Level | Time per Level |
|-----------------|------------------------|----------------|
| Fast learner | 2-3 attempts | 6-10 minutes |
| Average learner | 3-5 attempts | 10-15 minutes |
| Struggling learner | 5-8 attempts | 15-25 minutes |

### Scenario 3: Grade-Appropriate Placement

Students starting at their appropriate grade level:

| Starting Grade | Prior Knowledge Assumed | Est. Time to 3-Star Grade |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Grade 1 | None | 2-4 hours |
| Grade 2 | Basic add/sub to 10 | 2-4 hours |
| Grade 3 | Add/sub fluency | 4-6 hours |
| Grade 4 | Add/sub/mult/div basics | 2-4 hours |
| Grade 5 | All basic operations | 2-3 hours |

---

## Summary: Time to Full Mastery (All Grades 1-5)

| Student Profile | Estimated Time |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Already fluent (demonstrating mastery) | **2.5 hours** |
| Fast learner | **8-12 hours** |
| Average learner | **15-25 hours** |
| Below-average learner | **30-50 hours** |

### Per-Grade Estimates

| Grade | Fluent Student | Average Learner |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| Grade 1 | 22 min | 2-4 hours |
| Grade 2 | 30 min | 2-4 hours |
| Grade 3 | 38 min | 4-6 hours |
| Grade 4 | 34 min | 2-4 hours |
| Grade 5 | 30 min | 2-3 hours |

## Key Takeaways

1. **For placement/diagnostic purposes**: A fluent student can demonstrate mastery of all 77 levels in approximately 2.5 hours.

2. **For learning purposes**: Students building fluency from scratch should expect 15-25 hours of practice across all grades.

3. **Consistent time per level**: Because mastery counts are calibrated to difficulty, students spend roughly the same time per level regardless of content—the difference is the number of attempts needed.

4. **Overlap benefits**: Facts learned in earlier grades transfer forward, so cumulative time is less than the sum of individual grade times.

5. **Grade-appropriate starting points**: The diagnostic assessment places students at their appropriate level, avoiding wasted time on already-mastered content.
