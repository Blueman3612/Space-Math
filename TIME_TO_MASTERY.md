# Astro Math: Time to Mastery Analysis

This document provides a breakdown of the time required for students to achieve 3-star mastery (full CQPM targets) on all levels in Astro Math.

## What Astro Math Does

Astro Math is a **fluency training tool** that builds automaticity with math facts. It does not teach mathematical concepts—students are expected to already understand the operations. Instead, Astro Math improves **CQPM (Correct Questions Per Minute)** through timed practice until students achieve automatic recall.

**Assumptions:**
- Students entering a grade have conceptual mastery of prior grade standards
- Students understand the operations but need to build speed
- The goal is automaticity, not comprehension

## Time to Mastery

### How Mastery Counts Work

Each level's mastery count represents the number of correct answers a fluent student should achieve in 2 minutes at 85% accuracy. The target CQPM is simply mastery_count ÷ 2.

| Mastery Count | Target CQPM | Question Type |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| 60-80 | 30-40 | Basic facts with automatic recall |
| 40-60 | 20-30 | Single-digit operations |
| 20-40 | 10-20 | Extended facts, mental math |
| 10-20 | 5-10 | Multi-digit operations |
| 6-10 | 3-5 | Complex multi-step problems |

### Estimating Time to Mastery

The key variable for students building fluency is their **average time per correct answer** (including practice, retries, and building speed). Time to mastery can be estimated as:

**Total time = mastery_count × average time per correct answer**

| Avg. Time per Correct Answer | Student Profile | Description |
|------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| ~3 seconds | Already fluent | Automatic recall, just demonstrating mastery |
| ~15 seconds | Near fluent | Minor gaps, occasional hesitation |
| ~30 seconds | Developing fluency | Needs practice to build speed |
| ~1 minute | Building from baseline | Working toward automaticity |

### Time Estimates by Grade

| Grade | Mastery Count | Already Fluent | Near Fluent | Developing | Building from Baseline |
|-------|---------------|----------------|-------------|------------|------------------------|
| Grade 1 | 385 | 22 min | ~1.5 hr | ~3 hr | ~6 hr |
| Grade 2 | 372 | 30 min | ~1.5 hr | ~3 hr | ~6 hr |
| Grade 3 | 679 | 38 min | ~3 hr | ~5.5 hr | ~11 hr |
| Grade 4 | 562 | 34 min | ~2.5 hr | ~4.5 hr | ~9 hr |
| Grade 5 | 430 | 30 min | ~2 hr | ~3.5 hr | ~7 hr |
| **TOTAL** | **2,428** | **2.5 hr** | **~10 hr** | **~20 hr** | **~40 hr** |

### Time Estimates by Profile (All Grades)

| Student Profile | Avg. Time/Answer | Total Time (All Grades) |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Already fluent | ~3 sec | **2.5 hours** |
| Near fluent | ~15 sec | **~10 hours** |
| Developing fluency | ~30 sec | **~20 hours** |
| Building from baseline | ~1 min | **~40 hours** |

## Summary

| Student Profile | Time to Master All Grades (1-5) |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| Already fluent | **2.5 hours** |
| Near fluent (minor gaps) | **~10 hours** |
| Developing fluency | **~20 hours** |
| Building from grade-level baseline | **~40 hours** |
| Single grade (developing fluency) | **3-6 hours per grade** |

## Key Points

1. **Astro Math builds fluency, not conceptual understanding.** Students should already know how to perform operations; the game trains them to do so automatically.

2. **Mastery counts are CQPM targets.** A mastery count of 40 means the student should answer 20 questions correctly per minute (40 in 2 minutes at 85% accuracy).

3. **Prior-grade fluency is assumed.** Time estimates assume students entering Grade N have mastered Grade N-1 content.

4. **Time is driven by fluency gaps.** Students close to target CQPM will progress quickly; those building fluency from baseline will need more repetition.

5. **The diagnostic assessment identifies gaps.** Students don't need to work through content they've already mastered—the assessment places them appropriately.
