## Time Estimates

### Game Mechanics

- **Level timer**: 2 minutes per level
- **3-star requirement**: 100% of mastery count with ≥85% accuracy
- **Practical requirement**: Students must answer approximately mastery_count ÷ 0.85 total problems to account for allowed errors

### Scenario 1: Fluent Student (Demonstrating Mastery)

A student who already has automaticity with their math facts can complete levels at the minimum time of 2 minutes each:

| Grade | Levels | Minimum Time |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Grade 1 | 11 | 22 minutes |
| Grade 2 | 15 | 30 minutes |
| Grade 3 | 19 | 38 minutes |
| Grade 4 | 17 | 34 minutes |
| Grade 5 | 15 | 30 minutes |
| **TOTAL** | **77** | **154 minutes (~2.5 hours)** |

### Scenario 2: Learning Student (Building Fluency)

For students who need to learn and build automaticity with math facts, research suggests approximately **4 minutes per fact** to achieve mastery (based on math fluency intervention research).

**Unique Facts by Operation:**

| Operation | Approximate Unique Facts |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| Addition (basic facts) | ~100 facts |
| Subtraction (basic facts) | ~150 facts |
| Multiplication (0-12) | ~145 facts |
| Division (0-12) | ~144 facts |
| Advanced operations (multi-digit, fractions, decimals) | ~200 problems |
| **Total unique facts** | **~775 facts** |

### Scenario 3: Grade-Appropriate Placement

Students starting at their appropriate grade level with partial prior knowledge:

| Starting Grade | Prior Knowledge Assumed | Est. Time to 3-Star Grade |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Grade 1 | None | 8-12 hours |
| Grade 2 | Basic add/sub to 10 | 6-10 hours |
| Grade 3 | Add/sub fluency | 10-15 hours |
| Grade 4 | Add/sub/mult/div basics | 8-12 hours |
| Grade 5 | All basic operations | 6-10 hours |

## Summary: Time to Full Mastery (All Grades 1-5)

| Student Profile | Estimated Time |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Already fluent (demonstrating mastery) | **2.5 hours** |
| Above-average learner (75th percentile) | **40-50 hours** |
| Average learner (50th percentile) | **60-80 hours** |
| Below-average learner | **100+ hours** |

### Per-Grade Estimates (Starting from Zero)

| Grade | Fluent Student | Average Student |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| Grade 1 | 22 min | 8-12 hours |
| Grade 2 | 30 min | 6-10 hours |
| Grade 3 | 38 min | 10-15 hours |
| Grade 4 | 34 min | 8-12 hours |
| Grade 5 | 30 min | 6-10 hours |

## Key Takeaways

1. **For placement/diagnostic purposes**: A fluent student can demonstrate mastery of all 77 levels in approximately 2.5 hours.

2. **For learning purposes**: Students building fluency from scratch should expect 40-80 hours of practice across all grades.

3. **Overlap benefits**: Many facts are reinforced across grades (e.g., basic addition appears in Grades 1-5), so cumulative time is less than the sum of individual grade times.

4. **Grade-appropriate starting points**: Using the diagnostic assessment to place students at their appropriate starting level significantly reduces wasted time on already-mastered content.
